Investment firms that lend to healthcare companies are fielding increased interest from entrepreneurs as the banking crisis unfolds. Interest in debt was rising before Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. But uncertainty stemming from banking industry turmoil has sharpened startups’ focus on boosting their balance sheets with less equity financing, which has grown more costly, investors said. New York-based life sciences firm Catalio Capital Management makes venture-capital investments and backs publicly traded companies. In November, Catalio said it had raised more than $85 million for its first special-situations fund, a vehicle targeting debt and structured-equity deals for small and midsize private companies. Catalio has invested about half that pool and intends to raise a second special-situations fund, well ahead of schedule, because of demand, said George Petrocheilos, co-founder and a managing partner of the firm. Catalio hasn’t determined the amount of the next special-situations fund but expects it will be larger than the first, he said, adding that the firm can create financings tailored to life sciences companies. “This whole unfortunate situation with SVB is opening up opportunities for funds like ours,” Mr. Petrocheilos said. New York-based OrbiMed Advisors, which also invests in private and publicly held companies, raised its first dedicated credit and royalties fund in 2011. OrbiMed has had a steady volume of deals for this practice over the years, but the pullback in the equity markets and troubles in the banking sector have increased its prospects, said General Partner Matthew Rizzo. “For us, it’s allowed us to be even more selective on the opportunities,” Mr. Rizzo said. Mr. Rizzo said OrbiMed is finding that more large companies with well-established revenue bases are showing interest in credit and royalty financing, in which companies receive cash in exchange for sharing a portion of their revenue. That gives it the chance to put large amounts of capital to work in relatively low-risk companies. In January, OrbiMed led a senior secured term loan financing of up to $400 million for Caris Life Sciences, an Irving, Texas-based molecular-profiling company. OrbiMed in March also struck a debt financing deal worth up to $75 million for Palette Life Sciences, a Stockholm-based company with a portfolio of products used in radiotherapy and interventional oncology procedures. They include Barrigel, used to reduce side effects of radiation therapy. OrbiMed is opening an office in London to expand its credit and royalty, venture-capital and other investments in Europe, said Managing Partner Carter Neild. Runway Growth Capital LLC, an investment firm that lends to late- and growth-stage companies, makes about 30% of its loans in healthcare, said David Spreng, founder, chief executive and chief investment officer of the firm. While banks typically offer lower interest rates, investors such as Runway can often provide larger loans with flexible terms, such as an extended period of interest-only payments and loans stretched over longer terms, he said. The possibility of equity becoming even more difficult to raise during the banking crisis is leading more companies to consider debt, Mr. Spreng added.
