    "article = \"\"\"Kaiser Permanente, a pioneering integrated health system based on the West Coast, has agreed to acquire a Pennsylvania-based hospital operator in a bid to create a new national player in the rapidly consolidating healthcare market. The combination of Kaiser and Geisinger, which must be reviewed by federal and state agencies, would have more than $100 billion in revenue. The subsidiary, called Risant Health, aims to acquire four or five more hospital systems and get to total revenue of $30 billion to $35 billion over the next five years, the systems said. Geisinger Chief Executive Jaewon Ryu would lead Risant. “Kaiser Permanente, through Risant, is really stepping out, putting a stake in the ground, and saying we’re going to partner with these leading health systems,” Kaiser Chief Executive Greg Adams said. Both systems helped model the integration of health insurance, hospital ownership and other operations. The biggest healthcare companies in the U.S., including UnitedHealth Group Inc. and CVS Health Corp., have been moving in that direction, unveiling a growing roster of deals to pull together doctors, clinics and other operations with health-insurance units. These conglomerates say they aim to implement new payment models that are supposed to bolster quality and reduce costs. “Kaiser knows how to bring those pieces together and has been doing that for its entire history,” said Chas Roades, co-president of Gist Healthcare, a consulting firm owned by industry advisers Kaufman Hall. Mr. Roades said he expects a number of hospital systems would probably be eager to join Risant, because of Kaiser’s resources and expertise in managing patients’ health and the cost of care. “This puts them in the conversation with UnitedHealth and CVS Health in terms of developing a national care platform,” he said. Kaiser, founded in 1945 and based in Oakland, Calif., has long been a bellwether for uniting different healthcare functions. It reported $95.4 billion in revenue last year from 39 hospitals, 12.6 million insurance plan members and nearly 24,000 physicians. The nonprofit has most fully developed the integrated setup in its home state, where it has a commanding presence, but it also operates in other regions, including the Pacific Northwest, as well as Colorado and Hawaii. Geisinger, based in Danville, Pa., reported about $6.9 billion in revenue last year. It counts 10 hospitals and about 600,000 health plan enrollees and employs more than 1,700 doctors. \n",
