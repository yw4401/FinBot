      "A Mubadala Investment Co.-backed healthcare company said it agreed to acquire kidney-care provider Diaverum, extending the Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund’s bet on healthcare. M42, a newly launched healthcare operator owned by Mubadala and a partner company, G42, is acquiring Diaverum from U.K.-based buyout firm Bridgepoint Group PLC. BPT 0.17%increase; green up pointing triangle The deal value wasn’t disclosed. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the transaction values the business at more than $2 billion including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. M42 said it expects to close the deal later this year. A pre-markets primer packed with news, trends and ideas. Plus, up-to-the-minute market data. Diaverum, based in Sweden, oversees a global network of 440 dialysis clinics, almost triple the 155 facilities Bridgepoint inherited when it bought the business in 2007 for an undisclosed amount. Diaverum has also expanded geographically over that period, operating in 23 countries, up from 15.  Dialysis is a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly. It often involves diverting blood to a machine to be cleaned. The size of the dialysis market globally is expected to grow in coming years because of aging populations and the increased incidence of kidney disease related to diabetes and other conditions. Diaverum’s operations include 40 dialysis facilities in Saudi Arabia where Diaverum operates under a five-year contract with the Saudi Ministry of Health, according to the company’s website. Confidence in winning renewal of the license in 2024 was key to the deal, which gave M42 an advantage over other bidders because of its existing base in the region and Mubadala’s backing, said some bankers following the sale process.  Mubadala is the investment arm for the Abu Dhabi government. It oversees $284 billion in assets and invests across a range of industries including business services, energy, financials, healthcare and industrials. Bridgepoint manages more than €37 billion, equivalent to about $40.6 billion of assets, focusing its investments in industrials, business and financial services, consumer and healthcare, according to the firm’s website. Bridgepoint attempted to list Diaverum in an initial public offering in 2020. It withdrew the IPO after not achieving a high-enough valuation.\n",

      "Kaiser Permanente, a large California-based health care group with 39 hospitals and 24,000 doctors, said on Wednesday that it expected to acquire Geisinger Health, a smaller East Coast group, in an effort to develop a new company that would operate nonprofit community health systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If we can take much of what is in our value-based care platform and extend that to these leading community health systems, then we extend our mission,” Greg A. Adams, Kaiser’s chairman and chief executive, said in an interview. “We reach more people, we drive greater affordability for health care in this country.” Both organizations are nonprofit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kaiser will not absorb Geisinger, which will keep its name. Instead, Geisinger, which is headquartered in Danville, Pa., will be folded into Risant Health, a new nonprofit group that will operate independently. Geisinger’s chief executive, Dr. Jaewon Ryu, will serve as Risant’s chief executive when the deal is closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "ImageAn exterior view looking up at a medical building with “Kaiser Permanente” in large blue letters on its top with its logo.\n",
      "Credit...Mike Blake/Reuters\n",
      "What’s Next: Regulatory Review\n",
      "Federal and state regulators must approve the deal. While Mr. Adams did not say what other health systems he might be talking to regarding acquisitions, Kaiser said it hoped to invest $5 billion in Risant over the next five years, in addition to its spending on Kaiser’s core operations. The company expects to add five or six health systems to Risant in that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why It Matters: Increasing Consolidation\n",
      "Kaiser, which serves 13 million people in eight states and the District of Columbia, has built a reputation for delivering high-quality care at low costs. The organization operates like a health maintenance organization, in which it is paid a fixed sum to care for someone through a closed network of hospitals and doctors. But it has not succeeded in offering its model broadly across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The creation of Risant Health represents an opportunity for Kaiser, which had $95 billion in revenue last year, to become an even bigger and more influential organization by working with other hospital groups and health plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "The formation of the company is also a response to the rapid changes taking place in the health care industry. Large for-profit companies like health insurers, pharmacy chains and other corporations are scooping up physician practices and urgent care centers and devouring more of the country’s health care dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "In keeping with Kaiser’s model, the community health systems under Risant would invest in technology and preventive care to keep patients healthy, so they would need less expensive specialty and hospital care, Mr. Adams said.\n",
      "\n",
      "As national systems and new players grow larger, “they are pulling away in some respects from our communities and from our community health systems,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new venture “is a way to really ensure that not-for-profit, value-based community health is not only alive but is thriving in this country,” Mr. Adams added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background: A Tough Environment\n",
      "As hospital groups emerge from the pandemic, many are struggling with higher expenses for supplies and labor. Both Kaiser and Geisinger reported operating losses in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Covid has really shown not having integrated, value-based relationships puts our health systems and our communities at risk,” Mr. Adams said.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Geisinger has long focused on improving care, Dr. Ryu said the health system would benefit from Kaiser’s ability to invest in the kind of technology and preventive care necessary to keep people healthier. “This model made sense to us as a way to accelerate and further bolster those capabilities and bring better health into our communities,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because it has specialized in providing care under arrangements where it is paid a fixed amount, Kaiser has become one of the largest insurers in the profitable Medicare Advantage market, where its private plans are sold as an alternative to traditional Medicare.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Kaiser has not been immune to criticism for overbilling the federal government, and some people say its financial model means it can be slow to refer patients for costly services. Kaiser has defended its billing practices and says its doctors work with patients to provide the most appropriate care.\n",

      "Alzheimer’s disease treatment stocks are focused on Alzheimer’s disease, a degenerative brain disorder that results in declining memory and thinking skills and typically affects people in their mid-60s.According to the Alzheimer’s Association, neurons in other areas of the brain also begin to deteriorate as Alzheimer’s disease gets worse, resulting in the loss of basic human functions and overall cognitive impairment.This condition affects more than 6.7 million people in the US alone; it’s also the most common form of dementia and is the sixth leading cause of death in America. Treatments are available to alleviate Alzheimer’s disease symptoms, but because they do not affect the underlying causes of this neurodegenerative disease, they’re only a bandaid solution.Therapies approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include: rivastigmine by Novartis (NYSE:NVS); galantamine, developed by Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ); donepezil by Pfizer (NYSE:PFE); and AbbVie's (NYSE:ABBV) memantine.Since there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, death is often the result for patients as the ailment devastates the brain. And unfortunately, Alzheimer’s disease is rising in prevalence — a report from Research and Markets suggests that the global Alzheimer’s disease treatment market will be worth a significant US$9.64 billion by 2028 as more patients need treatment, and as more investments are made in biomarkers for diagnosis and drug development.Here the Investing News Network takes a look at a few of the biggest Alzheimer’s disease treatment stocks on the NASDAQ. Companies are listed in order of market cap from largest to smallest, and all data was current as of April 19, 2023.. Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) Company Profile.Market cap: US$42.27 billion; current share price: US$292.80.Massachusetts-based Biogen, a pioneer in the field of neuroscience, is developing, manufacturing and marketing therapies aimed at treating serious neurological, neurodegenerative, autoimmune and rare diseases.The global biotechnology firm’s research areas include Alzheimer's disease and dementia. However, Biogen’s launch of its FDA-approved Alzheimer’s disease drug Aduhelm faced a lot of pushback in 2022, both from the market and from Congress, over what was viewed as a hasty fast-track approval process and exorbitant costs to patients.In early 2023, Biogen is looking to give it another go, this time with LEQEMBI (lecanemab-irmb) for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, which the FDA has approved under its accelerated approval pathway. The drug was jointly developed by Biogen and Tokyo-based pharmaceutical company Eisai (OTC Pink:ESALF,TSE:4523). Intra-Cellular Therapies (NASDAQ:ITCI).Company Profile.Market cap: US$5.96 billion; current share price: US$62.59.As its name suggests, biopharma company Intra-Cellular Therapies is taking an intracellular approach to developing therapies for patients with complex psychiatric and neurologic diseases, including Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.Intra-Cellular Therapies is currently evaluating ITI-1284-ODT-SL, a deuterated form of lumateperone that comes in an oral disintegrating tablet; ITI-1284-ODT-SL is in Phase 1 studies, including drug-drug interaction studies. The company expects to commence Phase 2 clinical trials in agitation in patients with probable Alzheimer’s disease in 2023. 3. Axsome Therapeutics (NASDAQ:AXSM).Company Profile.Market cap: US$3.16 billion; current share price: US$72.64.New York-based Axsome Therapeutics is developing and commercializing a portfolio of novel therapies for disorders of the central nervous system with limited treatment options. Products currently on the market from the biopharmaceutical company include Auvelity, a rapid-acting oral antidepressant for the treatment of major depressive disorder; and Sunosi, a once-daily prescription medicine to treat excessive daytime sleepiness due to obstructive sleep apnea or narcolepsy.Axsome’s product pipeline includes AXS-05, a NMDA receptor antagonist with multimodal activity. It has breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA and is currently in Phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease agitation. \n",

    "Kaiser Permanente, a large California-based health care group with 39 hospitals and 24,000 doctors, said on Wednesday that it expected to acquire Geisinger Health, a smaller East Coast group, in an effort to develop a new company that would operate nonprofit community health systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "“If we can take much of what is in our value-based care platform and extend that to these leading community health systems, then we extend our mission,” Greg A. Adams, Kaiser’s chairman and chief executive, said in an interview. “We reach more people, we drive greater affordability for health care in this country.” Both organizations are nonprofit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaiser will not absorb Geisinger, which will keep its name. Instead, Geisinger, which is headquartered in Danville, Pa., will be folded into Risant Health, a new nonprofit group that will operate independently. Geisinger’s chief executive, Dr. Jaewon Ryu, will serve as Risant’s chief executive when the deal is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "ImageAn exterior view looking up at a medical building with “Kaiser Permanente” in large blue letters on its top with its logo.\n",
    "Credit...Mike Blake/Reuters\n",
    "What’s Next: Regulatory Review\n",
    "Federal and state regulators must approve the deal. While Mr. Adams did not say what other health systems he might be talking to regarding acquisitions, Kaiser said it hoped to invest $5 billion in Risant over the next five years, in addition to its spending on Kaiser’s core operations. The company expects to add five or six health systems to Risant in that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It Matters: Increasing Consolidation\n",
    "Kaiser, which serves 13 million people in eight states and the District of Columbia, has built a reputation for delivering high-quality care at low costs. The organization operates like a health maintenance organization, in which it is paid a fixed sum to care for someone through a closed network of hospitals and doctors. But it has not succeeded in offering its model broadly across the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of Risant Health represents an opportunity for Kaiser, which had $95 billion in revenue last year, to become an even bigger and more influential organization by working with other hospital groups and health plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formation of the company is also a response to the rapid changes taking place in the health care industry. Large for-profit companies like health insurers, pharmacy chains and other corporations are scooping up physician practices and urgent care centers and devouring more of the country’s health care dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "In keeping with Kaiser’s model, the community health systems under Risant would invest in technology and preventive care to keep patients healthy, so they would need less expensive specialty and hospital care, Mr. Adams said.\n",
    "\n",
    "As national systems and new players grow larger, “they are pulling away in some respects from our communities and from our community health systems,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new venture “is a way to really ensure that not-for-profit, value-based community health is not only alive but is thriving in this country,” Mr. Adams added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background: A Tough Environment\n",
    "As hospital groups emerge from the pandemic, many are struggling with higher expenses for supplies and labor. Both Kaiser and Geisinger reported operating losses in 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Covid has really shown not having integrated, value-based relationships puts our health systems and our communities at risk,” Mr. Adams said.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Geisinger has long focused on improving care, Dr. Ryu said the health system would benefit from Kaiser’s ability to invest in the kind of technology and preventive care necessary to keep people healthier. “This model made sense to us as a way to accelerate and further bolster those capabilities and bring better health into our communities,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it has specialized in providing care under arrangements where it is paid a fixed amount, Kaiser has become one of the largest insurers in the profitable Medicare Advantage market, where its private plans are sold as an alternative to traditional Medicare.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Kaiser has not been immune to criticism for overbilling the federal government, and some people say its financial model means it can be slow to refer patients for costly services. Kaiser has defended its billing practices and says its doctors work with patients to provide the most appropriate care.\n",

    "Alzheimer’s disease treatment stocks are focused on Alzheimer’s disease, a degenerative brain disorder that results in declining memory and thinking skills and typically affects people in their mid-60s.According to the Alzheimer’s Association, neurons in other areas of the brain also begin to deteriorate as Alzheimer’s disease gets worse, resulting in the loss of basic human functions and overall cognitive impairment.This condition affects more than 6.7 million people in the US alone; it’s also the most common form of dementia and is the sixth leading cause of death in America. Treatments are available to alleviate Alzheimer’s disease symptoms, but because they do not affect the underlying causes of this neurodegenerative disease, they’re only a bandaid solution.Therapies approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include: rivastigmine by Novartis (NYSE:NVS); galantamine, developed by Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ); donepezil by Pfizer (NYSE:PFE); and AbbVie's (NYSE:ABBV) memantine.Since there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, death is often the result for patients as the ailment devastates the brain. And unfortunately, Alzheimer’s disease is rising in prevalence — a report from Research and Markets suggests that the global Alzheimer’s disease treatment market will be worth a significant US$9.64 billion by 2028 as more patients need treatment, and as more investments are made in biomarkers for diagnosis and drug development.Here the Investing News Network takes a look at a few of the biggest Alzheimer’s disease treatment stocks on the NASDAQ. Companies are listed in order of market cap from largest to smallest, and all data was current as of April 19, 2023.. Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) Company Profile.Market cap: US$42.27 billion; current share price: US$292.80.Massachusetts-based Biogen, a pioneer in the field of neuroscience, is developing, manufacturing and marketing therapies aimed at treating serious neurological, neurodegenerative, autoimmune and rare diseases.The global biotechnology firm’s research areas include Alzheimer's disease and dementia. However, Biogen’s launch of its FDA-approved Alzheimer’s disease drug Aduhelm faced a lot of pushback in 2022, both from the market and from Congress, over what was viewed as a hasty fast-track approval process and exorbitant costs to patients.In early 2023, Biogen is looking to give it another go, this time with LEQEMBI (lecanemab-irmb) for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, which the FDA has approved under its accelerated approval pathway. The drug was jointly developed by Biogen and Tokyo-based pharmaceutical company Eisai (OTC Pink:ESALF,TSE:4523). Intra-Cellular Therapies (NASDAQ:ITCI).Company Profile.Market cap: US$5.96 billion; current share price: US$62.59.As its name suggests, biopharma company Intra-Cellular Therapies is taking an intracellular approach to developing therapies for patients with complex psychiatric and neurologic diseases, including Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.Intra-Cellular Therapies is currently evaluating ITI-1284-ODT-SL, a deuterated form of lumateperone that comes in an oral disintegrating tablet; ITI-1284-ODT-SL is in Phase 1 studies, including drug-drug interaction studies. The company expects to commence Phase 2 clinical trials in agitation in patients with probable Alzheimer’s disease in 2023. 3. Axsome Therapeutics (NASDAQ:AXSM).Company Profile.Market cap: US$3.16 billion; current share price: US$72.64.New York-based Axsome Therapeutics is developing and commercializing a portfolio of novel therapies for disorders of the central nervous system with limited treatment options. Products currently on the market from the biopharmaceutical company include Auvelity, a rapid-acting oral antidepressant for the treatment of major depressive disorder; and Sunosi, a once-daily prescription medicine to treat excessive daytime sleepiness due to obstructive sleep apnea or narcolepsy.Axsome’s product pipeline includes AXS-05, a NMDA receptor antagonist with multimodal activity. It has breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA and is currently in Phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease agitation. \n",

      "The abortion pill mifepristone is either banned or restricted to varying degrees in 27 states despite a Supreme Court decision that — for now — maintains Food and Drug Administration regulations allowing easy access to the medication.\n",
      "The Supreme Court, acting on an emergency basis, last week blocked lower federal court orders that had imposed severe restrictions on mifepristone even in some states where abortion remains legal.\n",
      "Patients previously were required by the FDA to obtain mifepristone in person from a health-care provider or take the medication under their supervision.\n",
      "While the Supreme Court’s decision at least temporarily maintains access to mifepristone in states that support broad access to abortion, it will have less or no impact in conservative states that banned the procedure since last summer, when the high court overturned the half-century-old federal constitutional right to abortion.\n",

NEW YORK: Automakers reported mixed US car sales in January, with strong demand for SUVs and pickup trucks continuing to provide a cushion in a declining overall auto market. .  Ford and Fiat Chrysler reported declines in year-over-year sales, while General Motors scored a modest increase and Toyota saw a more substantial jump. .  US car sales fell last year for the first time since the financial crisis and are projected to decline again in 2018. Still, analysts and industry executives expect US sales this year to come in above a solid 16 million vehicles amid low unemployment and strong consumer confidence. .  “US economic factors are very healthy and we’re seeing the effect in the auto industry — not just in strong demand for SUVs and pickups, but in demand for high trim versions of vehicles,” said Mark LaNeve, Ford’s vice president for US marketing. .

      " \"Now for breakfast we  shall want a frying-pan\" - (Harris said it was indigestible; but we  merely urged him not to be an ass, and George went on) - \"a tea-pot and a  kettle, and a methylated spirit stove.\"\n",
