Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) is the second major medical device maker to signal a recovery after rival Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) on Tuesday posted better-than-expected sales for the business. The company's glucose-monitoring device Freestyle Libre alone contributed $1.2 billion in sales. Abbott Chair and CEO Robert Ford said the rise signals a recovery in demand for surgical procedures, pointing to an improvement in staffing levels at hospitals across the U.S. \"Abbott Chair and CEO Robert Ford think the hospital systems have done a really good job right now at managing through the staffing shortages, and we're starting to see the impact there,\" Abbott Chair and CEO Robert Ford said during an earnings call. The strong results come after rival Johnson & Johnson reported similar growth in rival Johnson & Johnson's own medical devices unit, noting that surgical procedures are \"well in recovery.\" Abbott's stock is up more than 2% year to date, pushing Abbott's market value to around $195 billion.\n"
