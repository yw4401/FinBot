The company has faced some supply constraints this year, but a second contract manufacturer is ready to begin production of Wegovy, which would increase supply. In the first quarter of this year, Novo Nordisk's sales increased by 25% and operating profit rose by 28% in local currencies.

Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet, recently launched its own chatbot called Bard AI to rival Microsoft and OpenAI's ChatGPT. Tech investors are eager to see how much these industry leaders are investing in AI, as it is an area where they want to see hefty investments. Generative AI programs require specialized supercomputers that are not cheap, but tech CEOs emphasized the large sums of money they will be spending to build and run these applications. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, is under intense pressure to deliver AI products due to the perceived threat that Alphabet's core Google search engine faces from the sophisticated chatbots hitting the market.

      "Qualcomm has developed a new chip called the Cloud AI 100 that aims for parsimonious power consumption. In testing data published on Wednesday by MLCommons, an engineering consortium that maintains testing benchmarks widely used in the AI chip industry, Qualcomm's AI 100 beat Nvidia's flagship H100 chip at classifying images, based on how many data center server queries each chip can carry out per watt. Qualcomm's chips hit 227.4 server queries per watt versus 108.4 queries per watt for Nvidia. Qualcomm also beat Nvidia at object detection with a score of 3.8 queries per watt versus Nvidia's 2.4 queries per watt. Object detection can be used in applications like analyzing footage from retail stores to see where shoppers go most often. However, Nvidia took the top spot in both absolute performance terms and power efficiency terms in a test of natural language processing, which is the AI technology most widely used in systems like ChatGPT.\n",
