    "### Human: What are the key differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources?\n",
    "### Assistant: Renewable energy sources are those that can be replenished naturally in a relatively short amount of time, such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass. Non-renewable energy sources, on the other hand, are finite and will eventually be depleted, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Here are some key differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources:\n",
    "1. Availability: Renewable energy sources are virtually inexhaustible, while non-renewable energy sources are finite and will eventually run out.\n",
    "2. Environmental impact: Renewable energy sources have a much lower environmental impact than non-renewable sources, which can lead to air and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and other negative effects.\n",
    "3. Cost: Renewable energy sources can be more expensive to initially set up, but they typically have lower operational costs than non-renewable sources.\n",
    "4. Reliability: Renewable energy sources are often more reliable and can be used in more remote locations than non-renewable sources.\n",
    "5. Flexibility: Renewable energy sources are often more flexible and can be adapted to different situations and needs, while non-renewable sources are more rigid and inflexible.\n",
    "6. Sustainability: Renewable energy sources are more sustainable over the long term, while non-renewable sources are not, and their depletion can lead to economic and social instability.\"\"\"\n",

      " on Tuesday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped Wall Street’s expectations, despite a decline in sales driven by the lower demand for the company’s Covid vaccine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pharmaceutical giant’s stock closed slightly lower Tuesday at $39.06. Shares are down more than 23% year to date through Tuesday’s close, putting the company’s market value at around $220.47 billion. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s what Pfizer reported compared with Wall Street’s expectations, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:\n",
      "\n",
      "Earnings per share: $1.23 adjusted vs. 98 cents expected \n",
      "Revenue: $18.28 billion vs. $16.59 billion expected\n",
      "Pfizer’s net income of $5.54 billion, or 97 cents per share, fell from $7.86 billion, or $1.37 per share, during the year-earlier quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company reported first-quarter sales of $18.28 billion, down 29% over the same period a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Covid-related sales contributed $7.1 billion to that number. Pfizer raked in $3 million in Covid vaccine revenue and $4 million in sales of its Covid antiviral pill Paxlovid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking ahead, the New York-based company maintained its 2023 sales forecast of $67 billion to $71 billion. Pfizer also reiterated its full-year adjusted earnings outlook of $3.25 to $3.45 per share.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Pfizer continues to expect Covid-related sales to decline this year. The company reaffirmed its forecast of $13.5 billion in Covid vaccine sales in 2023 and $8 billion in revenue for Paxlovid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said during the earnings call that the company expects 2023 to be a “transition year” for Covid sales as the U.S. pivots to the commercial market for Covid products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Covid vaccine, Paxlovid sales\n",
      "Quarterly sales of the company’s Covid vaccine declined $10 billion, or 75%, compared with the year-earlier period, on what Pfizer said was primarily driven by lower contracted deliveries and softer demand in international markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. government contracted deliveries slowed as the nation prepared to shift Covid products to the commercial market later this year, the company said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sales of Paxlovid increased $2.8 billion year over year amid new launches in certain international markets and strong demand in China due to increased Covid cases. Sales were also driven by final deliveries associated with a U.S. contract finalized in late December.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paxlovid first entered the U.S. market under emergency-use authorization in late December 2021. Pfizer hopes to win full Food and Drug Administration approval for the drug this year, but still expects 2023 sales to fall 58% compared to the previous year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bourla said Pfizer expects higher uptake of Paxlovid after this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We then expect that in years 2024 and beyond, the courses sold and used will more closely align,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company also expects U.S. uptake of its Covid vaccine to decline this year and in 2024, Bourla said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the CEO noted that Pfizer expects vaccination rates to rebound starting in 2025 and “continuing in 2026 and beyond,” assuming the company successfully launches several Covid combination vaccine treatments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bourla said the company expects a similar trend outside the U.S., with some variations in certain countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other drug products\n",
      "Excluding Covid product sales, Pfizer said first-quarter revenue grew 5% over the same period a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "That growth was fueled by products from recently acquired companies, including Biohaven Pharmaceutical’s migraine drug Nurtec ODT and Global Blood Therapeutics’ sickle cell disease treatment Oxbryta, which contributed $167 million and $71 million, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company said the increase was also driven by strong sales of drugs like Sulperazon, an antibiotic for the treatment of urinary tract infections, and blood thinner medication Eliquis.\n",
      "\n",

Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin developed the system in part by using a transformer model, which is similar to those that support Google’s chatbot Bard and OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT. \n",

      "The study’s participants trained the decoder by listening to several hours of podcasts within an fMRI scanner, which is a large piece of machinery that measures brain activity. The system requires no surgical implants. Once the AI system is trained, it can generate a stream of text when the participant is listening to or imagines telling a new story. The resultant text is not an exact transcript, rather the researchers designed it with the intent of capturing general thoughts or ideas. \n",
      "\n",
      "According to a news release, the trained system produces text that closely or precisely matches the intended meaning of the participant’s original words around half of the time. \n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, when a participant heard the words “I don’t have my driver’s license yet” during an experiment, the thoughts were translated to, “She has not even started to learn to drive yet.”  \n",
      "\n",
      "“For a noninvasive method, this is a real leap forward compared to what’s been done before, which is typically single words or short sentences,” Alexander Huth, one of the leaders of the study, said in the release. “We’re getting the model to decode continuous language for extended periods of time with complicated ideas.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Participants were also asked to watch four videos without audio while in the scanner, and the AI system was able to accurately describe “certain events” from them, the release said. \n",
      "\n",
      "As of Monday, the decoder can’t be used outside of a laboratory setting because it relies on the fMRI scanner. But the researchers believe it could eventually be used via more portable brain-imaging systems.\n",

      "Seniors with early Alzheimer’s disease will face major hurdles to get treated even if promising new drugs roll out more broadly in the coming years, putting them at risk of developing more severe disease as they wait months or perhaps years for a diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. health-care system is not currently prepared to meet the needs of an aging population in which a growing number of people will need to undergo evaluation for Alzheimer’s, according to neurologists, health policy experts and the companies developing the drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are not enough dementia specialists or the needed testing capacity in the U.S. to diagnose everyone who may benefit from a new treatment like Eisai\n",
      " and Biogen\n",
      "’s Leqembi. After patients are diagnosed, the capacity may not exist — at least initially — to provide the twice monthly intravenous infusions for everyone who is eligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers estimate that the wait time from the initial evaluation to the confirmatory diagnostic tests to the infusions could range anywhere from a year and a half to four years or longer. Those months are critical for people with Alzheimer’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The whole process from that time of the family physician conversation to the point of infusion, I worry how long it will take and the complexities of the patient navigating through all of that to successfully get to the end,” Anne White, president of neuroscience at Eli Lilly\n",
      ", which is developing its own Alzheimer’s treatment, told CNBC.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are promising innovations in development, such as blood tests and injections that patients would take at home, which could make it significantly easier to get diagnosed and treated in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "White also said Lilly is confident that more doctors will get into the field and help to alleviate capacity issues, as awareness grows that medicines are entering the market to treat Alzheimer’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "But time spent waiting robs early patients of their memory and ability to live independently. Alzheimer’s gets worse with time, and as patients deteriorate into more advanced stages of the disease, they no longer benefit from treatments like Leqembi that are designed to slow cognitive decline early.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 2,000 seniors transition from mild to moderate dementia from the disease a day, according to estimates from the Alzheimer’s Association. At that stage, they become ineligible for Leqembi.\n",
      "\n",
      "The central challenge is that a large and rapidly growing group of people have early memory loss and other thinking problems known as mild cognitive impairment. This condition is often, though not always, a sign of early Alzheimer’s disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "An estimated 13 million people in the U.S. had mild cognitive impairment last year, according to a study published in the Alzheimer’s and Dementia Journal. As the U.S. population ages, the number of people with this condition is expected to reach 21 million by 2060, the study projected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. health-care system will deal with major logistical challenges in diagnosing the growing population of people with early Alzheimer’s — even before patients face potential issues with accessing treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s a very large population of undiagnosed cognitive impairments that need to be evaluated in order to determine if people are eligible for treatment,” said Jodi Liu, an expert on health policy at the Rand Corporation. Access to drugs like Leqembi is severely restricted because Medicare for now will only cover the $26,500-per-year treatment for people participating in clinical trials. Medicare has promised to provide broader coverage if Leqembi receives full approval from the Food and Drug Administration, which Eisai expects to happen in July.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eisai has estimated that 100,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed and eligible for Leqembi by the third year of the treatment’s rollout. The sum is a fraction of the total population that could benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those patients could have other options if new treatments emerge from trials with positive marks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eli Lilly will publish clinical trial data on its antibody infusion donanemab in the second quarter of this year. If the data is positive, the company will ask the FDA to approve the drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eisai’s U.S. CEO Ivan Cheung and Lilly’s White said during the companies’ respective earnings calls in February that they are focused on working with the U.S. health system to address the challenges of rolling out of Alzheimer’s treatments.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The primary goal right now during this launch phase [...] is really get the market ready in terms of the diagnostic pathway, the infusion capacity, the education on how to monitor for this therapy, get all the hospitals and clinics ready,” Cheung said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not enough specialists\n",
      "Long lines are expected at the offices of geriatricians, neurologists and radiologists as millions of people with mild cognitive impairment undergo evaluation to diagnose whether they have Alzheimer’s disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Demand for geriatricians — doctors who are experts in diseases that affect the elderly — is expected to outstrip the number of specialists available in the field through at least 2035, according to projections from the federal Health Resources and Services Administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The American Academy of Neurology told Medicare in a February letter that increased demand for Alzheimer’s treatments will put substantial pressure on neurologists, who will need additional resources. The federal data predicts a substantial shortage of these specialists in rural areas through at least 2035.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You just look at the neurologists, look at geriatricians — there are fewer and fewer geriatricians per person in the U.S.,” Rand’s Liu said. “It’s just a few number of specialists to do this kind of work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "White said Lilly has heard stories of patients waiting six to 12 months to see a neurologist or other doctors who treat dementia due to current capacity issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of radiologists — who also play a role in diagnosing the disease — is expected to decline in the U.S. through 2035 even as demand increases, the data shows.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a study published in 2017, Liu and other Rand researchers estimated an initial wait of 18 months for patients to get evaluated by a dementia specialist, tested to confirm a diagnosis, and then treated in the first year that an Alzheimer’s antibody treatment becomes available. The wait would decrease to 1.3 months by 2030 as the patient backlog is cleared, they estimated at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "But more recent research found that the wait would actually increase as demand created by an aging U.S. population outstrips the supply of specialists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients seeking a first specialist visit could face an initial wait of 20 months, according to a study by researchers at the University of Southern California published in the journal Alzheimer’s and Dementia in 2021. The delay could increase to about four years as early as 2028 and grow longer through 2050, the study found.\n",
      "\n",
      "The journal is published by the Alzheimer’s Association.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both studies are based on assumptions made before Leqembi received expedited approval from the FDA in January. Actual wait times could differ from the studies’ projections.\n",
      "\n",
      "PET scans cumbersome\n",
      "Two types of tests can diagnosis Alzheimer’s disease: PET scans and spinal taps. PET scans are accurate and safe diagnostic tools, but they are also cumbersome and expensive, said Dr. David Russell, a neurologist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients are injected with a tracer that makes brain abnormalities visible to the machine that does the imaging. Tracers have to be made for each patient and used on the same day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t have the infrastructure to roll out PET scanning on a major scale,” said Russell, director of clinical research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders in New Haven, Connecticut. He is the principal investigator on the clinical trials of Leqembi and donanemab at the institute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medicare coverage of PET scans for Alzheimer’s patients is also limited right now. The insurance program for seniors will only cover one scan per lifetime, and only when the patient is participating in a clinical trail approved by the federal Centers for for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s concerning because people may actually test negative at one point but then obviously as they age, they may need to get tested again,” White said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early Alzheimer’s disease can also be diagnosed with a spinal tap, in which fluid around the spinal cord is extracted with a catheter and tested. While there’s plenty of capacity to do spinal taps, this option isn’t attractive to many patients due to unfounded fears that it’s painful and dangerous, Russell said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though “there’s a lot of resistance” to the procedure, it is well tolerated and safe, he noted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rural areas at a disadvantage\n",
      "The lack of access to PET scans is even more of an issue for patients who live in rural areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are an estimated 2,300 PET scan machines in the U.S., according to a 2021 study published in Alzheimer’s and Dementia. But the machines are often in bigger cities, which puts people in rural areas at a disadvantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are certainly areas that don’t have a PET scanner, rural areas, so people would need to travel to a health center that has a PET scanner,” Liu said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a large, sparsely populated rural state like New Mexico, many patients would have to drive three to five hours to get a PET scan in a city such as Albuquerque, said Dr. Gary Rosenberg, a neurologist and director of the New Mexico Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not California or the East Coast where everything’s very compressed and people can travel and get to a center pretty easily and go through these kinds of treatments,” Rosenberg said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The state has an estimated population of 43,000 people with dementia, and there are very few neurologists outside of the Albuquerque area, Rosenberg said. The New Mexico Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center in Albuquerque is one of only three such facilities funded by the federal National Institute of Aging in a vast region stretching west from Texas to Arizona.\n",
      "\n",
      "To do a PET scan, a tracer has to be made for each patient off-site in Phoenix, flown on a private plane to Albuquerque and used within hours because the tracers have a short shelf life, according to Rosenberg. The whole process costs more than $12,000 per patient, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s logistically going to be very challenging,” Rosenberg said.\n",
      "\n",
      "IV infusion capacity\n",
      "After spending months or possibly years waiting to get diagnosed with early Alzheimer’s, patients would then be eligible for intravenous infusions of Leqembi. But the U.S. doesn’t currently have the capacity to give infusions twice monthly for everyone who likely has the disease, Russell said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Having an IV infusion every two weeks would sort of ration people to availability and that’s a problem,” Russell said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The University of New Mexico Hospital is already maxed out with demand for infusion therapies for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases, and could have a “problem” adding new capacity, said Rosenberg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intravenous infusions of monoclonal antibodies like Leqembi aren’t difficult to administer, Russell said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The infrastructure to offer infusions should expand rapidly once industry sees there’s demand for treatments like Leqembi. But the process of building out capacity could still take a couple years, Russell said. He believes big players like CVS\n",
      " will provide infusions for Alzheimer’s disease on a major scale if they see there’s a large and stable market.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In one sense, capitalism works, and if it looks like that’s going to be the future, I think infusion centers will explode onto the scene,” the neurologist said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eisai and Biogen hope to move early Alzheimer’s patients to a single monthly dose of Leqembi after they’ve completed their initial course of twice monthly infusions, which could help alleviate some of the capacity issues with infusions over time. They plan to ask the FDA to approve this plan in early 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eli Lilly’s Alzheimer’s candidate antibody treatment donanemab is a single monthly dose, potentially making the logistics of administration easier if the drug gets approved. Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Lilly’s chief medical officer, told analysts during the company’s first-quarter earnings call that he expects many patients will be able to stop taking donanemab at 12 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blood tests could reduce wait times\n",
      "Though the projected wait times to get diagnosed and treated are sobering, innovations on the horizon promise to significantly improve access to Alzheimer’s drugs over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blood tests for Alzheimer’s are in development and some are already on the market. Primary-care doctors could administer the tests, which would ease the burden on patients, especially those in rural communities where the closest PET scan machine is hours away.\n",
      "\n",
      "These tests detect proteins in the blood associated with Alzheimer’s. They promise to help diagnose the disease before people display cognitive symptoms, potentially giving patients the chance to get treated before they suffer irreparable brain damage, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least three blood tests made by C2N Diagnostics, Quest Diagnostics\n",
      " and Quanterix\n",
      " are currently on the market. But they are used to evaluate people who are already presenting symptoms and aren’t available on the mass scale needed for the expected increase in Alzheimer’s patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "C2N’s PrecivityAD test costs $1,250 and is not covered by insurance — though the company has a financial assistance program. Quest Diagnostics’ AD-Detect test costs $650. Quest’s test is covered by some insurance plans but not Medicare at the moment. The company also has a financial assistance program. Quanterix wouldn’t disclose the price of its test, which insurance does not cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, these are not stand-alone tests that can definitively diagnose Alzheimer’s. But the tests could help identify the patients who likely have the disease, which would narrow the population that needs further evaluation and reduce wait times for dementia specialists or confirmatory PET scans.\n",
      "\n",
      "A study in the journal Alzheimer’s and Dementia estimated that a cognitive test combined with a blood test could slash wait times for dementia specialists from 50 months down to 12 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eisai believes that inexpensive blood tests could completely replace PET scans and spinal taps by the fourth year of Leqembi’s rollout. The quicker diagnosis could increase the number of people eligible for treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rosenberg said widespread availability of blood tests will allow mobile clinics to go into rural communities and identify who has markers associated with Alzheimer’s. This would allow patients in remote towns avoid the hours-long drive to cities with PET scan machines, Rosenberg said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a game changer,” the neurologist said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lilly is developing at least two blood tests. The company is already using one test in clinical trials and hopes to commercialize it sometime this year. It is developing a second test through a collaboration with Roche. White said it is reasonable to expect that in a few years blood tests could replace more burdensome PET scans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Injections could make treatment easier\n",
      "Biogen and Eisai are also developing an injectable form of Leqembi which patients could administer themselves with an autoinjector similar to insulin pens, saving the trip to a site that provides intravenous infusions. They plan to ask the FDA to approve these so-called subcutaneous injections in early 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eli Lilly is also conducting clinical trials on an antibody treatment called remternetug as a self-administered injection. But the promise of injections that can be administered at home could make companies reluctant to invest in building out intravenous infusion capacity, Russell said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the future, Alzheimer’s diagnosis and treatment could be folded into routine checkups with a family doctor, Russell said. When people turn 50 and head in to get a colonoscopy or a cholesterol check, the doctor could also run a blood test for Alzheimer’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the test comes back positive, the doctor could then schedule patients for an MRI and get them started on an autoinjector treatment, Russell said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s going to be the way that we’re looking at it in the not too distant future,” he said.\n"

An estimated 13 million people in the U.S. had mild cognitive impairment last year, according to a study published in the Alzheimer’s and Dementia Journal. As the U.S. population ages, the number of people with this condition is expected to reach 21 million by 2060, the study projected.\n",
      "The U.S. health-care system will deal with major logistical challenges in diagnosing the growing population of people with early Alzheimer’s — even before patients face potential issues with accessing treatment. “There’s a very large population of undiagnosed cognitive impairments that need to be evaluated in order to determine if people are eligible for treatment,” Jodi Liu, an expert on health policy at the Rand Corporation, said during the companies’ respective earnings calls in February.\n",
      "Access to drugs like Leqembi is severely restricted because Medicare for now will only cover the $26,500-per-year treatment for people participating in clinical trials. Medicare has promised to provide broader coverage if Leqembi receives full approval from the Food and Drug Administration, which Eisai expects to happen in July. Eisai has estimated that 100,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed and eligible for Leqembi by the third year of the treatment’s rollout. The\n"

      "\n",
      "The push by attorneys general from 23 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories adds to mounting pressure on the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to end a controversial policy that severely restricts access to new drugs such as Eisai and Biogen\n",
      "’s Leqembi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice-monthly infusions of Leqembi have shown promise in slowing progression of early Alzheimer’s to more advanced stages of the mind-wasting disease. Medicare’s decision to restrict coverage means only wealthy seniors can afford to pay $26,500 per year out of pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We ask that CMS provide full and unrestricted Medicare coverage for FDA-approved Alzheimer’s treatments, consistent with its decades-long practice of covering FDA-approved prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries,” the attorneys general, led by Oklahoma’s Gentner Drummond, wrote to CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure and Health Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n",
      "\n",
      "The attorneys general acknowledged that Leqembi is associated with certain side effects, such as brain swelling and bleeding, but they said families and their doctors can assess these risks against the benefit of patients being able to recognize their loved ones for a longer period.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a nation with deep political divisions, the push to provide broad access to Alzheimer’s treatments is one of the few issues both sides of the aisle can rally around. More than 70 House lawmakers and 18 senators called on Medicare to provide unrestricted coverage of Alzheimer’s treatments in February.\n",
      "\n",
      "The push by members of Congress and state attorneys general comes after Medicare rejected a request by the Alzheimer’s Association to cover Leqembi without any conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“After careful review of the request and supporting documentation, we are making this decision because, as of the date of this letter, there is not yet evidence meeting the criteria for reconsideration,” CMS said in February. Unlike Medicare, the Veterans Health Administration agreed to cover Leqembi for veterans ages 65 and older who meet certain eligibility criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leqembi received expedited approval from the Food and Drug Administration in January. Under its current policy, Medicare will only cover antibody treatments that receive expedited approval for patients participating in clinical trials. Eisai’s trial has concluded, which means the overwhelming majority of seniors do not have access to the drug.\n",

      "The article discusses the push by Democratic and Republican attorneys general in nearly half of U.S. states to call on Medicare to provide unrestricted coverage of antibody treatments for Alzheimer's disease. The letter was signed by attorneys general from 23 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories. The letter adds to mounting pressure on the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to end a controversial policy that severely restricts access to new drugs such as Eisai and Biogen's Leqembi. The letter acknowledges that Leqembi is associated with certain side effects, such as brain swelling and bleeding, but it says families and their doctors can assess these risks against the benefit of patients being able to recognize their loved ones for a longer period. The letter comes after Medicare rejected a request by the Alzheimer's Association to cover Leqembi without any conditions. The letter also notes that the decision puts older Americans living in rural areas at a disadvantage, because clinical trials are typically hosted in larger cities far from small towns. The letter also notes that Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia cost the U.S. $321 billion in 2022, which is a substantial financial burden on federal health insurance programs.

      "LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) has pledged to deliver critical new medicines more quickly in low-income nations, but its first such vaccine effort faces hurdles likely to delay distribution in poorer countries by several years, global health officials told Reuters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pfizer made a commitment on more equitable access last year, following criticism that it prioritized wealthy nations for doses of its COVID-19 shot early in the pandemic. The company says it wants to shorten a timeline in which poorer countries often get vaccines many years after they are available elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drugmaker received a $28 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in September to support the launch of the respiratory syncytial virus vaccine in poorer countries, where RSV - a common cold-like virus - is much more likely to be lethal for very young children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pfizer's maternal RSV vaccine is expected to be approved for use in pregnant women in August in the United States and several months later in Europe, and the company plans to launch the product in both markets in the fall. Its peak sales forecast is of more than $2 billion annually together from the maternal vaccine and an RSV shot for older adults.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the vaccine will need a different delivery system to be used in developing countries in Africa and Asia, including alternative packaging and syringes. Preparations for those modifications are just beginning, according to the World Health Organization and the company - which is likely to push back delivery by several years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The case highlights how equitable global access will require better advance planning by drugmakers, governments and health organizations, health officials say.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They could have tried sooner,\" said Erin Sparrow, WHO's technical officer for the RSV vaccine, referring to Pfizer. \"It's a little bit disappointing, but they are doing the right thing now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pfizer says it is committed to a faster timeline for rolling out medicines to poor nations but acknowledges that there are challenges in meeting such goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are committed to working with the appropriate organizations, including regulatory authorities and other global health partners, to help ensure the vaccine candidate, once approved, is available in lower- and middle-income countries as quickly as possible,\" a Pfizer spokesperson said when asked about the timeline for the RSV shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview last month, Pfizer's head of vaccines research and development Annaliesa Anderson said the company still aimed to make its vaccine – the first of its kind – available for pregnant women in low-income countries more or less in the \"same time frame\" as in wealthy countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had pledged last May to offer its existing portfolio, as well as newly developed drugs and vaccines, at a not-for-profit basis to 45 lower-income countries on a faster timeline than in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company had learned during the COVID-19 pandemic that \"parallel development\" to meet the needs of different regions was possible, Anderson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "LEARNING CURVE\n",
      "Rates of RSV have surged since the pandemic. Inoculating pregnant women against RSV can protect babies from the virus that kills nearly 100,000 children worldwide each year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of those children are under five years old, with 98% living in low and middle-income countries that have fewer healthcare resources to treat the infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pfizer has yet to take a number of steps needed to make the vaccine available in developing countries, according to global health officials and the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "They include seeking approval for the shot from the WHO, whose authorization is used by governments that don't have a strong domestic drugs regulator, and by nonprofits - such as the global vaccine alliance Gavi - that fund purchases in low-income countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early discussions with the WHO are underway, but the process will be complicated because Pfizer's RSV vaccine is not designed for syringes that automatically disable after one injection, which are preferred by the health agency for safety reasons to prevent reuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the RSV shot is currently only available in a single-dose vial. In lower-resource settings, multi-dose vials are often used because they are cheaper and simpler to distribute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Multi-dose vials require the addition of a preservative, which means the manufacturer needs to run new trials to ensure there is no impact on the vaccine’s safety or efficacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gates grant will be used to fund trials of a multi-dose vial, which are likely to begin next year and may take another year to complete, a source with knowledge of the plans said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Gates Foundation official said that the investment in the RSV program represented a learning process for the organization and the company on the steps needed for more equitable access.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have already reached a partnership for a maternal vaccine in earlier stages of development against Group B Streptococcus, which kills around 90,000 babies a year and causes 46,000 stillbirths, over half of them in sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We very much want to see that time gap [between high and low-income countries] reduced, such that there's no space between the two,\" said Padmini Srikantiah, lead on the RSV vaccine launch at Gates.\n",
      "\n",
      "She still expects it to be several years before the RSV vaccine is launched in lower-income countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think we're doing better than in years before,\" she said. \"It's a process.\"\n"

      "Guggenheim analyst Seamus Fernandez said pharmaceutical patent expirations will accelerate from 2026 to 2032 and that most will face competition from biosimilars that compete with complex biologic drugs.\n",

      "Amgen, which launched Amjevita in January, slightly increased its forecast for full-year 2023 revenue to $26.2 billion to $27.3 billion, from the previous outlook of $26 billion to $27.2 billion.\n",

      "Amgen said its R&D costs rose 12% in the first quarter, while Gilead Science Inc (GILD.O) reported a 25% research spending jump to $1.4 billion, driven partly by higher expenses in late-stage clinical studies.\n",

      "The biggest overhaul of existing medical laws in two decades is aimed at ensuring all Europeans have access to both innovative new treatments and generic drugs, and ending huge divergences in access and price between countries, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides told reporters after publication.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were few major changes in the proposal from the draft reviewed by Reuters earlier this month, except for details of changes to protections before generic versions of drugs enter the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Commission proposes to cut the length of basic market exclusivity that drugmakers get before generics can enter the market to eight from 10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it also offers a sweetener for companies: they get two more years of protection if they launch their new medicines in all 27 member states within two years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kyriakides said the new incentives system \"would provide access to new medicines to around 70 million more citizens compared to today\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Patient and consumer groups generally cheered the proposals. The European Public Health Alliance (EPHA) called them \"a great win for people across the EU\" because of the changes to what it sees as a too-generous incentives system for industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following publication, the European Parliament, Commission and member states will now thrash out final details of the law, which could take years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Commission hopes the reforms will create a \"single European market for medicines\", while preserving Europe's attractiveness for pharmaceutical investment, Kyriakides added.\n",

      "Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said in a statement on Wednesday that \"the proposals are poison for innovation and competitiveness in Europe.\" GSK (GSK.L) said the EU must \"regulate for growth and competitiveness\" because companies \"have choices on where our capital and resources are focused\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The reforms also aim to prevent drug shortages like those seen this winter with critical antibiotics by requiring companies to notify the EU of possible supply issues earlier.

      "Kaiser Permanente, a pioneering integrated health system based on the West Coast, has agreed to acquire a Pennsylvania-based hospital operator in a bid to create a new national player in the rapidly consolidating healthcare market. The combination of Kaiser and Geisinger, which must be reviewed by federal and state agencies, would have more than $100 billion in revenue. The subsidiary, called Risant Health, aims to acquire four or five more hospital systems and get to total revenue of $30 billion to $35 billion over the next five years, the systems said. Geisinger Chief Executive Jaewon Ryu would lead Risant. “Kaiser Permanente, through Risant, is really stepping out, putting a stake in the ground, and saying we’re going to partner with these leading health systems,” Kaiser Chief Executive Greg Adams said. Both systems helped model the integration of health insurance, hospital ownership and other operations. The biggest healthcare companies in the U.S., including UnitedHealth Group Inc. and CVS Health Corp., have been moving in that direction, unveiling a growing roster of deals to pull together doctors, clinics and other operations with health-insurance units. These conglomerates say they aim to implement new payment models that are supposed to bolster quality and reduce costs. “Kaiser knows how to bring those pieces together and has been doing that for its entire history,” said Chas Roades, co-president of Gist Healthcare, a consulting firm owned by industry advisers Kaufman Hall. Mr. Roades said he expects a number of hospital systems would probably be eager to join Risant, because of Kaiser’s resources and expertise in managing patients’ health and the cost of care. “This puts them in the conversation with UnitedHealth and CVS Health in terms of developing a national care platform,” he said. Kaiser, founded in 1945 and based in Oakland, Calif., has long been a bellwether for uniting different healthcare functions. It reported $95.4 billion in revenue last year from 39 hospitals, 12.6 million insurance plan members and nearly 24,000 physicians. The nonprofit has most fully developed the integrated setup in its home state, where it has a commanding presence, but it also operates in other regions, including the Pacific Northwest, as well as Colorado and Hawaii. Geisinger, based in Danville, Pa., reported about $6.9 billion in revenue last year. It counts 10 hospitals and about 600,000 health plan enrollees and employs more than 1,700 doctors. \n"

      "A Mubadala Investment Co.-backed healthcare company said it agreed to acquire kidney-care provider Diaverum, extending the Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund’s bet on healthcare. M42, a newly launched healthcare operator owned by Mubadala and a partner company, G42, is acquiring Diaverum from U.K.-based buyout firm Bridgepoint Group PLC. BPT 0.17%increase; green up pointing triangle The deal value wasn’t disclosed. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the transaction values the business at more than $2 billion including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. M42 said it expects to close the deal later this year. A pre-markets primer packed with news, trends and ideas. Plus, up-to-the-minute market data. Diaverum, based in Sweden, oversees a global network of 440 dialysis clinics, almost triple the 155 facilities Bridgepoint inherited when it bought the business in 2007 for an undisclosed amount. Diaverum has also expanded geographically over that period, operating in 23 countries, up from 15.  Dialysis is a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly. It often involves diverting blood to a machine to be cleaned. The size of the dialysis market globally is expected to grow in coming years because of aging populations and the increased incidence of kidney disease related to diabetes and other conditions. Diaverum’s operations include 40 dialysis facilities in Saudi Arabia where Diaverum operates under a five-year contract with the Saudi Ministry of Health, according to the company’s website. Confidence in winning renewal of the license in 2024 was key to the deal, which gave M42 an advantage over other bidders because of its existing base in the region and Mubadala’s backing, said some bankers following the sale process.  Mubadala is the investment arm for the Abu Dhabi government. It oversees $284 billion in assets and invests across a range of industries including business services, energy, financials, healthcare and industrials. Bridgepoint manages more than €37 billion, equivalent to about $40.6 billion of assets, focusing its investments in industrials, business and financial services, consumer and healthcare, according to the firm’s website. Bridgepoint attempted to list Diaverum in an initial public offering in 2020. It withdrew the IPO after not achieving a high-enough valuation.\n"

      "Investment firms that lend to healthcare companies are fielding increased interest from entrepreneurs as the banking crisis unfolds. Interest in debt was rising before Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. But uncertainty stemming from banking industry turmoil has sharpened startups’ focus on boosting their balance sheets with less equity financing, which has grown more costly, investors said. New York-based life sciences firm Catalio Capital Management makes venture-capital investments and backs publicly traded companies. In November, Catalio said it had raised more than $85 million for its first special-situations fund, a vehicle targeting debt and structured-equity deals for small and midsize private companies. Catalio has invested about half that pool and intends to raise a second special-situations fund, well ahead of schedule, because of demand, said George Petrocheilos, co-founder and a managing partner of the firm. Catalio hasn’t determined the amount of the next special-situations fund but expects it will be larger than the first, he said, adding that the firm can create financings tailored to life sciences companies. “This whole unfortunate situation with SVB is opening up opportunities for funds like ours,” Mr. Petrocheilos said. New York-based OrbiMed Advisors, which also invests in private and publicly held companies, raised its first dedicated credit and royalties fund in 2011. OrbiMed has had a steady volume of deals for this practice over the years, but the pullback in the equity markets and troubles in the banking sector have increased its prospects, said General Partner Matthew Rizzo. “For us, it’s allowed us to be even more selective on the opportunities,” Mr. Rizzo said. Mr. Rizzo said OrbiMed is finding that more large companies with well-established revenue bases are showing interest in credit and royalty financing, in which companies receive cash in exchange for sharing a portion of their revenue. That gives it the chance to put large amounts of capital to work in relatively low-risk companies. In January, OrbiMed led a senior secured term loan financing of up to $400 million for Caris Life Sciences, an Irving, Texas-based molecular-profiling company. OrbiMed in March also struck a debt financing deal worth up to $75 million for Palette Life Sciences, a Stockholm-based company with a portfolio of products used in radiotherapy and interventional oncology procedures. They include Barrigel, used to reduce side effects of radiation therapy. OrbiMed is opening an office in London to expand its credit and royalty, venture-capital and other investments in Europe, said Managing Partner Carter Neild. Runway Growth Capital LLC, an investment firm that lends to late- and growth-stage companies, makes about 30% of its loans in healthcare, said David Spreng, founder, chief executive and chief investment officer of the firm. While banks typically offer lower interest rates, investors such as Runway can often provide larger loans with flexible terms, such as an extended period of interest-only payments and loans stretched over longer terms, he said. The possibility of equity becoming even more difficult to raise during the banking crisis is leading more companies to consider debt, Mr. Spreng added.\n"

      "Mark Bertolini, former chief executive of health insurance giant Aetna Inc. and hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, will take the helm of Oscar Health Inc. as it seeks to turn a profit and carve out a role as a technology supplier in the healthcare industry. Mr. Bertolini, 66 years old, will take the post effective next Monday, the company said. He will succeed Mario Schlosser, 44, who co-founded Oscar in 2012 with Joshua Kushner and will take the new title of president of technology, reporting to Mr. Bertolini. Mr. Schlosser will also remain on Oscar’s board, which Mr. Bertolini will join, the company said. Oscar is expected to announce the changes Tuesday. Mr. Bertolini said he would initially focus on ensuring Oscar meets its goal of having a profitable insurance business this year and full-company profitability in 2024. Beyond that, he said, he thinks the company can supply technology tools to help doctors and health systems interact with patients and manage their care, a different approach than some large insurers that have been more focused on buying up doctor groups, clinics and other assets. “The digital platform has an opportunity to really change healthcare,” he said. “What we’re thinking about is, how can we use it to enable the provider system instead of owning them.”  Still, that would pit Oscar against many of the largest companies in the industry, including UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s Optum arm, Elevance Health Inc. and Cigna Group. Mr. Bertolini was a longtime health-insurance official who became chief executive of Aetna in 2010. He sold Aetna, one of the country’s biggest health insurers, to CVS Health Inc. in 2018 for nearly $70 billion. He left the CVS board in 2020. In early 2022, he became co-CEO of Bridgewater, stepping down earlier this month. Mr. Bertolini said his stint as chief executive there was always intended to be limited. He has been advising Oscar for the past 18 months, Mr. Schlosser said. “I don’t have too many more of these opportunities to change the system that I’ve known since the beginning of my career back in 1983,” Mr. Bertolini said. Oscar, of New York, has said it is using technology to make the experience of its roughly 1.15 million members simpler and more frictionless. Most of its members are enrolled in individual and small-employer plans, including a product it offers with Cigna. The company, which has never posted a profitable year, reported an accumulated deficit of $2.6 billion at the end of 2022. It had about $4 billion in revenue last year and posted a loss of about $610 million. Last year, Oscar said it would pull insurance operations out of Arkansas and Colorado. It said last August that a Florida health plan to which it was supplying administrative and technology services had terminated their deal.\n"

He believes the company can supply technology tools to help doctors and health systems interact with patients and manage their care, a different approach than some large insurers that have been more focused on buying up doctor groups, clinics, and other assets. This would pit Oscar against many of the largest companies in the industry, including UnitedHealth Group's Optum arm, Elevance Health Inc., and Cigna Group. Bertolini was a longtime health-insurance official who became chief executive of Aetna in 2010. He sold Aetna, one of the country's biggest health insurers, to CVS Health in 2018 for nearly $70 billion. He left the CVS board in 2020. In early 2022, he became co-CEO of Bridgewater, stepping down earlier this month. He has been advising Oscar for the past 18 months. Last year, Oscar said it would pull insurance operations out of Arkansas and Colorado. It said last August that a Florida health plan to which it was supplying administrative and technology services had terminated their deal.\n",

      "Medical-device makers’ stocks are basking in the good times. That is a marked shift from the turbulence of recent years, when device makers contended with inflationary pressures and a drop in medical procedures as hospitals faced staffing shortages and many patients deferred surgery during the pandemic. While the industry was far from the only sector to be affected by Covid-19, it suffered more than large-cap healthcare peers such as drugmakers and insurers. Those industries were relatively immune to the pandemic’s economic shocks, with insurers actually benefiting from a decline in surgical procedures. Now, that picture is starting to reverse, and device makers are looking more resilient than their healthcare counterparts. Not only have cost pressures such as parts shortages started to abate, but procedure volumes are rebounding as Covid-19 restrictions loosen worldwide. And while pharma and insurers continue to face political pressure in Washington, device makers are relatively insulated from policy risk, says Asad Haider, a senior healthcare strategist at Goldman Sachs. Shares of Boston Scientific BSX 0.17%increase; green up pointing triangle, Edwards Lifesciences EW 1.45%increase; green up pointing triangle and Stryker SYK 0.48%increase; green up pointing triangle are all up around 10% or more so far this year. The iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF is up 3.8% this year, compared with a less than 1% gain for the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index and a 2.1% decline for the iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF. “These stocks have become expressions of improving procedure volumes and cost pressures not getting any worse,” says Mr. Haider. He added that some companies, such as Boston Scientific, are also benefiting from a new product cycle. One example of a growth area for Boston Scientific as well as competitors such as Medtronic MDT -0.47%decrease; red down pointing triangle is a technology known as pulsed-field ablation, a new method for treating irregular heart rhythm conditions that could help minimize complications. JPMorgan estimates the broad electrophysiology market to be worth $8 billion in annual sales. Many of the top large-cap device makers reported relatively rosy fourth-quarter earnings while issuing 2023 guidance that was above analyst expectations. First-quarter earnings reports are expected to continue showing a healthy return to normal as hospital procedures bounce back. The first quarter will also make for an easy comparison. At around the same time last year, the Omicron variant negatively affected growth because it limited hospital capacity and procedure volumes. The expected beats this quarter could lead some companies to raise full-year guidance earlier than normal, writes JPMorgan analyst Robbie Marcus. “While normally we don’t see many MedTech companies raise full-year guidance after 1Q, we think most will be hard pressed not to raise by at least the 1Q beat if they deliver the results we are expecting,” Mr. Marcus says. A big caveat is that industry names are expensive, with investor favorites such as Boston Scientific and Stryker trading at more than 25 times forward earnings. But Jared Holz, a healthcare-equity strategist at Mizuho, says strong revenue growth means the high multiples shouldn’t be big deterrents for investors. “We would argue both could post in-line quarters or even miss by a tad and few investors would be compelled to sell or alter their respective views,” he writes. A miss across the board doesn’t seem likely anyway. A recent Needham analysis of Google search trends revealed that searches in the U.S. for 20 elective medical procedures were at 115% of pre-Covid levels. Additionally, a Raymond James note citing KaufmanHall data recently pointed to a 7% increase in operating-room minutes in February compared with last year. In addition, the use of anesthesia for procedural sedation was up 4.6%, which analyst John Ransom noted was the first increase since June 2022. Investors will also be paying close attention when industry behemoth UnitedHealth Group UNH 0.33%increase; green up pointing triangle reports first-quarter earnings before the bell on Friday. The company’s remarks on procedure volumes can move the shares of medical-device makers as well as hospitals. Medical-device makers are still working through some of the aftershocks of the pandemic, including persistent inflation in things such as costlier electronic components. But as long as business increasingly feels like the pre-Covid normal, investors are likely to remain positive on the sector.\n"
